    "Everyone should watch the Bachelor(ette). I blindly live by this axiom and assume that everyone understands the beauty that is *Sister Wives* meets the *Dating Game* meets the Jerry Springer hosted *Baggage* (if you haven't seen this, take a weekend and get back to me). And yes, I will shut down all of you sexists out there who believe this show is better suited for the female audience. That's like saying that sports are only for men, and if you believe this then you are most likely a douchebag and your opinion is nullified by default.\n",

    "But let's get down to the point. Countless number (exageration) of people who watch this show attempt to predict who is going home, when they will go home, and, of course, who is going to win the season. Well, this is the first step in an attempt to build a probabistic model that will forcast the odds of each contestant by learning from past season patterns.  However, there is little structured data about the television show, so I had to collect it myself. Well, I had to set up a webscraper to do it for me."
